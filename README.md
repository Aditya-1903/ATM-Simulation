# ATM-Simulation

The purpose of this project is to simulate a simple Automated Telling Machine(ATM).

Each User has two Accounts: a Checking account and a Savings account.
The program loads User Account numbers and Pins from a csv file.
Each User has an Account number and a Personal Identification Number (PIN). 
Both must by typed into the simulation to gain access to their accounts.
In case of more than 3 invalid pin attempts, account will be blocked for security reasons.


After successful login, the users can deposit, withdraw, transfer and check the balance  in their checking and savings accounts.
After each of the operations, the balance in the respective accounts will be updated accordingly.
The program terminates when the user wishes to exit.
